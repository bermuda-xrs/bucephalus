# Unattended run - progress log (iteration 3)

Branch `iteration-3`, from `main` at `1d911cc`. Main is fast-forwarded only at
the end, and only if the suite, the frozen gate and the Part 5 audit pass.

## Part 1 - medium security findings

- **Found first: the suite wrote the operator's real memory** (38edfa1). See
  DECISIONS U2 - waiting for the user.
- **1.1 state out of synced folders** - database, anchor and run records of a
  checkout under OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud/Google Drive go to platformdirs;
  notice once; nothing moved (DECISIONS U1). `test_sync_folder_state.py`,
  red first. The serve test's server had no scratch user dirs and opened the
  real memory directory - fixed in the same change.
