# Unattended run - progress log (iteration 3)

Branch `iteration-3`, from `main` at `1d911cc`. Main is fast-forwarded only at
the end, and only if the suite, the frozen gate and the Part 5 audit pass.

## Part 1 - medium security findings

- **Found first: the suite wrote the operator's real memory** (38edfa1). See
  DECISIONS U2 - waiting for the user.
- **1.1 state out of synced folders** - database, anchor and run records of a
  checkout under OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud/Google Drive go to platformdirs;
  notice once; nothing moved (DECISIONS U1). `test_sync_folder_state.py`,
  red first. The serve test's server had no scratch user dirs and opened the
  real memory directory - fixed in the same change.
- **1.2 recycled PIDs** - already closed in Phase E (D42: start-time rule,
  `kill_tree(expect_start=)`); re-swept every signalling site. The gap left:
  a pid validated when the tree was listed was signalled later by NUMBER.
  Now the identity check goes through the kill's own handle (Windows:
  OpenProcess TERMINATE|QUERY, GetProcessTimes, TerminateProcess on the
  same handle) or pidfd (Linux >= 5.3); macOS has no pidfd, so there it is
  check-then-signal, stated in the code. Popen-owned kills act on our own
  unreaped child and cannot hit a recycled pid. Red first:
  `test_a_kill_pinned_to_another_start_time_signals_nothing` (real kernel),
  `test_posix_checks_identity_before_it_signals` (fake kernel).
